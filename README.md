# My_First_RAG_Model'

Overview:
I am curious about the implementation of a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Model. This experiment will teach me more about AI Models, loading data using embedded models, and enhancing prompts using queried data from a vector database.

Objective:
Once the RAG works properly with test data, I plan to try it with real data from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database.
